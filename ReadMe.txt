This is a simple submod that replaces the Create A Hero with a custom hero with a lot of usefuly abilities for testing.

**Installation**: Copy paste _______testing_submod.big into your edain folder
**Uninstallation**: Delete _______testing_submod.big

__Info__
To get the submod to work you have to do two things before you enter a skirmish game:
1. Enable Custom Heroes
2. Select a custom hero (for imladris and rohan you need to use the trick)

When you enter the game, instead of a custom hero you will see a spellbreaker, recruitable for 0 resources and instantly. This special hero has some useful testing abilities: https://edain.fandom.com/wiki/User:The_Necromancer0/TestHero

***Changing Realms has a tendency to mess things up with recruitment buildings (barracks, siege works, etc...), therefore it is recommend to rebuild them after changing the realm. If it looks like the upgrade change didn't work then make sure to either destroy the building or if it's a neutral plot then let it return to neutral for a second.***

In addition, the spellbreaker:
- reveals stealthed units whereever you have vision
- is fast
- takes very little damage

I'm looking for feedback on it, mainly on what other abilities could be useful and what bugs you encountered. This isn't a full submod yet, it's just an idea that ran through my head and that I wanted to test. See if it would be a viable way to make testing edain easier, as currently you either have to grind for a while to get everything leveled up or you have to use testing maps which makes it harder to replicated bugs on other maps.
